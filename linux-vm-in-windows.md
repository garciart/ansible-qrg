# Create a Linux Virtual Machine in Windows

Here are instructions to create and run a Linux virtual machine in Windows, using the VMware Workstation Player for Windows and CentOS Stream 9. This setup will allow you to write and run the Ansible playbooks in the tutorial. Once again, this is one of many options available to run Linux in Windows.

## Download CentOS Stream

***CentOS Stream*** is a free and open-source Linux distribution maintained by the CentOS Project[^1]. CentOS Stream is based on Fedora Linux, and it is the community-supported upstream source for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

1. Open a browser and navigate to <https://www.centos.org/>:

    ![The CentOS Project](img/install_01.png)

2. Click on the **Downloads** link at the top of the page. The **Download** page should appear:

    ![CentOS Downloads](img/install_02.png)

3. Click on the **CentOS Stream** tab and select the latest version of CentOS Stream:

    ![CentOS Stream Download](img/install_03.png)

4. Click on the **x86_64** architecture link. Your browser should start downloading the image, and if it asks if you would like to open or save the file, click on **Save**. Wait until your browser completes the download, then open your **Downloads** folder. Check that the download was successful:

    ![Downloads folder](img/install_04.png)

    > **WARNING** - By default, most browsers will download the disk image to your **Downloads** folder. I recommend you move the image to another location so you do not accidentally delete it. I also recommend you do not use a folder linked to a cloud service, like OneDrive, since the image is large and transferring it to and from the cloud can cause delays. Just remember the path to the new location; you will need it later.

## Download and Install VMware Workstation Player for Windows

***VMware Workstation Player*** is a Type-2 Hypervisor that can run virtual machines and appliances on multiple operating systems, including Windows. It is free for personal use.

The latest version of Workstation Player, version 17, is compatible with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 or later. However, you should use the VMware Compatibility Guide at <https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php> to ensure you use the version of Workstation Player that is compatible with your version of Windows.

1. Open a browser and navigate to <https://www.vmware.com>:

    ![VMware](img/install_05.png)

2. Click on the **Products** tab and select **Workstation Player**. You may also navigate directly to <https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html>:

    ![Workstation Product Link](img/install_06.png)

3. When the **VMware Workstation Player** page appears, click on the **DOWNLOAD FOR FREE** link:

    ![VMware Workstation Player](img/install_07.png)

4. A new tab or window will open. Ensure you select the latest version, then click on the **GO TO DOWNLOADS** link:

    ![Download VMware Workstation Player](img/install_08.png)

5. When the **Download** page appears, click on the **Download** button for VMware Workstation Player for Windows 64-bit Operating Systems:

    ![Download Product](img/install_09.png)

6. Your browser should start downloading the file, and if it asks if you would like to open or save the file, click on **Save**. Wait until your browser completes the download, then open your **Downloads** folder. Right-click on the downloaded file and select **Run as administrator**:

   ![Downloads folder](img/install_10.png)

   > **WARNING** - Once again, most browsers will download the disk image to your **Downloads** folder. I recommend you move the image out of your **Downloads** folder to another location that is not linked to a cloud service, like OneDrive. Just remember the path to the new location; you will need it later.

7. If your system's User Account Control asks, ***"Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?"***, click on **Yes**:

   ![User Account Control](img/install_11.png)

8. When the ***Welcome to the VMware Workstation 17 Player Setup Wizard*** dialog appears, click on **Next**:

   ![VMware Workstation 17 Player Setup](img/install_12.png)

10. When the **Custom Setup** dialog appears, ensure the following options are set, click **Next** to continue:

    - **Install to** - This is the location of the VMware executables; the default value should work on your system.
    - **Enhanced Keyboard Driver** - This feature allows you to use key combinations, like **[Ctrl]** + **[Alt]** + **[Del]** or **[Win]** + **[L]**, within the virtual machine without being intercepted by the Windows host operating system. It also allows to use additional features on international and non-standard keyboards. However, you will not use any special key combinations or require any special keyboard features in the tutorial, so you can leave this unchecked.
    - **Add VMware Workstation console tools into system PATH** - This option allows you to run VMware command-line interface (CLI) commands, like **vmrun**, without having to prepend the path to the VMware executables. You can leave this checked, but you will not be using any console commands in the tutorial.

    ![Custom Setup](img/install_14.png)

11. When the **User Experience Settings** dialog appears, ensure the following options are set, click **Next** to continue:

    - **Check for product updates on startup** - Leave this checked to ensure the application is up-to-date when opened.
    - **Join the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program** - If you would like to join the program, leave this checked. However, you do not need to join the program to perform the tasks in the tutorial.

8. Once the `update` command is complete, enter the following commands at the prompt to check for upgrades and remove any packages that are no longer required.

   ```bash
   # Update installed packages to the latest version available to this distro
   sudo dnf -y upgrade
   # Remove dependencies not needed by installed packages
   sudo dnf -y autoremove
   # Remove temporary and cached package files
   sudo dnf -y clean all
   ```

9. At this time, the default Python interpreter installed in CentOS Stream 9 is Python 3.9. However, the latest version of Python available for CentOS Stream 9 is Python 3.11. Use the following commands to change the default version of Python 3; enter your password when prompted:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y python3.11
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11
   python3 --version
   ```

   > **NOTE** - This action will not affect the Python interpreter used by system applications, like `dnf` and `yum`. That interpreter is located at `/usr/libexec/platform-python`.

That's it! You now have a Linux host that you can use with the tutorial. Good luck!
